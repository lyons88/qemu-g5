/*
 * ATI R300/R350 -- the host-GPU rendering backend interface.
 *
 * This header is the whole contract between the device and whatever
 * draws its triangles on the host. It deliberately names no QEMU type:
 * a request is plain data, the backend keeps no device state, and the
 * three entry points below are the only ones the device calls. That is
 * what lets phase 2's milestone M3 move the backend onto its own thread
 * -- a request is already everything a worker needs -- and what lets a
 * Metal or SDL_GPU implementation replace ati_r350_gl.c without the
 * draw path noticing.
 *
 * Coordinates in a request are the device's own: y increases downward
 * and the origin is the render target's top-left corner. The backend
 * never touches a QEMU display backend or a window.
 *
 * The render target is RESIDENT (milestone M3). ati_r350_gl_target()
 * sizes it, ati_r350_gl_seed() copies emulated VRAM into it and
 * ati_r350_gl_fetch() copies it back out, and between those the caller
 * may draw into it as often as it likes without a byte crossing the
 * bus. M2 uploaded the destination rectangle twice and read it back for
 * every single draw; on this host that was 5.2 ms of the 6.5 ms a
 * full-screen draw cost (doc/radeon9800/glbench).
 *
 * What that buys has to be paid for in coherency, and the rules are
 * stated where they are enforced -- see "GL-OWNED RENDER TARGET" in
 * ati_r350_3d.c. The backend's own part of the contract is only this:
 * it holds one target, it holds it until told otherwise, and seed and
 * fetch are the only ways bytes move.

 * Interpolated texture coordinate SETS a request carries, and texture

 * ONE coordinate set, and that is a consequence rather than a limit.
 * The caller only offloads a draw whose fragment program the translator
 * could express, and that shape is a single fetch from unit 0 addressed
 * by coordinate SET 0 -- anything else needs a fetch inside the program,
 * which this contract's `us_main()` cannot perform. So a request can
 * never carry a second set, and the vertex layout below does not spend
 * a GL attribute on one; the sixteen GL 3.3 core guarantees are exactly
 * filled as it stands. The device's own R300_TEXCOORDS is eight,
 * because its software rasterizer really does interpolate that many for
 * Mac OS X 10.5.
 *
 * The unit count is the device's, and asserted equal to it: a request
 * names a texture per unit even though today's translated programs read
 * only unit 0, so that a backend growing multi-unit sampling does not
 * need the contract changed underneath it.

 * the two paths agree to the last bit rather than merely to the eye.
 * The layout, in order, with C = R350_GL_TEXCOORDS:
 *
 *   0..1              x, y            this vertex
 *   2..5              r, g, b, a
 *   6..(5+2C)         s, t per coordinate set, set 0 first
 *   (6+2C)..(11+2C)   triangle vertex 0/1/2 positions
 *   (12+2C)..(23+2C)  triangle vertex 0/1/2 colours
 *   (24+2C)..(23+8C)  triangle vertex 0/1/2 coordinates, all sets each
 *   (24+8C)           1.0f / signed area, computed on the HOST
 *   (25+8C)..(36+8C)  triangle vertex 0/1/2 SECOND colours
 *   (37+8C)           1.0f / signed area again
 *   (38+8C)..(40+8C)  triangle vertex 0/1/2 1/w
 *
 * The second colour is the one a fragment program can add to the
 * modulated texel -- Chess.app's specular term -- and it is carried at
 * the corners like the first so the fragment stage interpolates it with
 * the same weights.
