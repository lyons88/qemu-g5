 * ATI Radeon R350 -- R300 3D draw engine, as used by Mac OS X's

 * The R300 family has no dedicated 2D blitter worth using: the OS X

 * This file rasterizes those draws straight into VRAM.
 *
 * Scope, matched to what the driver actually submits (live-captured
 * corpus, 2026-08-24): QUADS/TRIANGLE lists with vertices embedded in
 * the command stream (PRIM_WALK=3), 12/8/3-dword vertex layouts,
 * one texture unit, nearest sampling of ARGB8888 textures with
 * unnormalized (pixel) coordinates, vertex-color modulation, and
 * src-alpha/inv-src-alpha blending. Everything else traces and skips.

 * enough to carry a coordinate positionally or a program that computes
 * one. A guest binds a texture for the draws that sample it and leaves
 * it bound across the ones that do not, so "bound" and "used" are
 * different sets, and three decisions below need the second one.
 *
 * What USES a texture is the fragment program, and it has already said
 * so: `tex_dst` is the frame register its first LD/PROJ writes, and -1
 * when the program performs no fetch at all. That is the same answer the
 * shading path acts on -- a program with no texture instruction samples
 * nothing however much is bound -- so this only brings the setup into
 * agreement with what the pixels already do.
 *
 * iTunes' visualiser is what named this. Its full-surface clears are
 * giant point sprites carrying a real dark COLOR_0 and a fragment
 * program with no texture instruction (US_CONFIG's FIRST_TEX clear, so
 * the level contributes no texture slots at all), issued while the
 * texture the NEXT draws sample is already bound. Read as `textured`
 * they lost that colour three times over: discarded as a texture
 * coordinate, replaced by a white flat constant, and then whitened again
 * at the sprite's corners. 255 of 255 bound-but-fetchless draws in the

 * texel index this model's sampler wants -- one multiply by the size of
 * the unit BEING FETCHED, which is the only unit whose size the answer
 * can depend on.
 *
 * The guests are the authority on the unit, and they say it in their own
 * constants: Mac OS X 10.5's menu-bar filter binds unit 0 at 1103x24 and
 * carries k21 = (0.000906616, 0.0416665) = (1/1103, 1/24), which it
 * multiplies into every coordinate immediately before the fetch; its
 * neighbour binds 1024x22 and carries (1/1024, 1/22); a third binds
 * 32x22 and carries (1/32, 1/22). A program that divides by the bound
 * size just before LD is a program whose LD consumes a normalised
 * coordinate.
 *
 * LD and PROJ still do the same thing: r300_fs_frame() puts 1.0 in the
 * routed coordinate's fourth component, so the projective divide a
 * directly-routed coordinate would take is the identity. A COMPUTED
 * coordinate with a real q is not yet divided by it -- see the note in
 * doc; that is a separate gap and not this one.
 *
 * A unit this draw does not bind reads WHITE, not black: the same 1x1
 * white texture the GL backend binds for an untextured draw, and the
 * value that leaves a modulate program computing its colour operand
 * alone rather than blacking the draw out.

 * `size[]` is rebuilt INDEXED BY INPUT REGISTER, with a register no
 * element feeds left at zero. r300_vs_input() finds an element's dwords
 * by summing the sizes before it, and that stays exact because the
 * skipped registers contribute nothing and DST_VEC_LOC ascends.
 *
 * THE ROUTING IS ONLY BELIEVED WHEN IT DESCRIBES THE VERTEX WE ACTUALLY
 * HAVE, and that guard is the whole reason this is safe to add to the
 * shared vertex path. A previous attempt at reading these registers
 * regressed the 10.4 desktop to flat blocks, and the census says why:
 * across five 10.4 captures (20867 draws) the register is a MISFIT for
 * 1633 of them -- never written, still reading its all-zero reset value,
 * which decodes as sixteen FLOAT_1 elements all pointing at in[0]. Take
 * the routing only when the element count and every element's dword
 * count agree with the vertex, no element skips dwords, and no element
 * names a register this model does not keep. Under that test the census
 * changes exactly TWO draws in everything this project has ever
 * captured, and both of them are Leopard's multi-tap compositor draws.
 *
 * `guess` IS WHAT AN INLINE VERTEX HAS INSTEAD OF ARRAY BOUNDARIES: the
 * whole vertex's dword count from a caller that could only split it four
 * at a time, and zero from a caller whose sizes are real. A VBUF draw
 * fetches element i from bound array i, so array i's dword count IS
 * element i's and a disagreement means the registers are stale -- refuse,
 * as above. An IMMD draw has no such thing, so the guard above refuses
 * every inline vertex whose elements are not all FLOAT_4. Mac OS X 10.5's
 * Aqua chrome strip is one: 0x2150/0x2154 = 0x01030001/0x23030201 names
 * FOUR elements of 2, 4, 2 and 4 dwords into in[0..3], the guess splits
 * the same twelve dwords 4, 4, 4 into in[0..2], the counts disagree, and
 * in[3] -- which that draw's vertex program forwards to a texture
 * coordinate -- reads the (0,0,0,1) default. One texel for every pixel,
 * again. So when the caller has only a guess, and the elements the
 * registers describe add up to EXACTLY the vertex in hand, the registers
 * are the better answer and replace the guess wholesale.
 *
 * That the sum has to match is not a formality; it is the same test as
 * before by another route. The all-zero reset value is refused twice over
 * (no LAST_VEC, and its second element does not ascend past its first),
 * and a stale layout left by another draw only survives if it describes a
 * vertex of exactly this size out of elements this model keeps -- which
 * is the most any register can claim.
 *
 * The added branch has its own census, over every register log this
 * project holds -- 40 logs, 276835 draws, each decided by BOTH the
 * shipped function and this one. It moves 209 draws, every one of them
 * an inline draw in a Mac OS X 10.5 capture, and not one draw in any
 * 10.4, OS 9 or saver capture: those hold 20599 inline draws for it to
 * have moved, so the zero is a result and not an absence. Seeded the
 * VBUF way -- the bound arrays, `guess` zero -- the two functions
 * disagree on 0 of the 276835.

 *   - floorf()-1 / ceilf()+1 widen that by a further pixel, so the
 *     rasterizer's un-widened floorf()/ceilf() bounds stay inside;
 *   - the four clamps below are character for character the ones
 *     r300_raster_tri() applies, and r300_span_clip() only ever
 *     narrows a row further.
 *
 * So x1 <= x0 or y1 <= y0 here means every scan loop there is empty.
 * The other refusals are NOT that proof and must not be treated as one:
 * a non-finite or out-of-range coordinate says only that this helper
 * declined to think about the draw, a zero pitch still lets the
 * rasterizer write row 0 over and over, and the VRAM trim below drops
 * rows using a widened x1 the real primitive may fall well short of.

 *
 * The shape is deliberately the same as the M1 replay harness, because
 * that is what was measured: this builds the same self-contained
 * request out of live device state that a capture record carried on
 * disk, hands it to the backend, and puts the rectangle back into VRAM
 * for the existing scanout to display. Anything the backend cannot
 * render falls back to the software rasterizer PER DRAW and is counted
 * -- a correct hybrid frame beats a complete GL frame that is wrong.
 */
/*
 * =====================================================================
 * GL-OWNED RENDER TARGET
 * =====================================================================
 *
 * The offload keeps the render target on the host GPU across draws.
 * That is where M3's speed comes from -- M2 uploaded the destination
 * rectangle twice and read it back for every single draw, 5.2 ms of the
 * 6.5 ms a full-screen draw cost on this host -- and it is also the one
 * place in this project where being wrong is SILENT. So the rules are
 * written down here, and every one of them is enforced by a call
 * somewhere rather than by a convention.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT. At any moment either no target is resident (`gl_res`
 * false, and the device behaves exactly as gl=off does), or:
 *
 *   - the resident target is the VRAM rectangle at `gl_res_off` with
 *     pitch `gl_res_pitch` under swapper xor `gl_res_xr`;
 *   - inside the SEEDED rectangle (gl_v*) the GPU copy is correct;
 *   - inside the DRAWN rectangle (gl_d*), which is always contained in
 *     the seeded one, the GPU copy is NEWER than VRAM;
 *   - outside the seeded rectangle the GPU holds nothing anyone may read.
 *
 * WHO MAY LOOK, AND WHAT THEY MUST DO FIRST. Everything that reads or
 * writes VRAM outside the 3D draw path calls ati_r350_gl_release() or
 * ati_r350_gl_touch() before doing so, which fetches the drawn
 * rectangle back and stops trusting the GPU copy:
 *
 *   scanout            ati_r350_update_display(), and the cursor's own
 *                      VRAM read, which runs off a timer
 *   the 2D engine      every blit, host-data push and scaler run
 *   the CP             ring and indirect-buffer fetches, write-backs
 *   MM_DATA            the register-indirect CPU window
 *   a 3D draw that     r300_run_prims(), before the software rasterizer
 *   falls back         touches the same VRAM
 *   a texture fetch    r300_run_prims(), when the sampled range overlaps
 *   reset, unrealize   ati_r350_reset_hold(), ati_r350_exit()
 *
 * THE ONE READER THAT CANNOT BE HOOKED, and what is done about it. The
 * guest CPU reaches VRAM through a plain RAM BAR: its loads are host
 * loads and no callback exists to intercept them, and its stores are
 * visible only after the fact through the dirty bitmap. So residency is
 * never allowed to survive a point at which the guest could execute an
 * instruction. In this device that point is exact rather than
 * approximate: a whole ring or indirect buffer is drained inside the
 * single guest store to CP_RB_WPTR or CP_IB_BUFSZ that kicked it, with
 * the BQL held throughout, so no guest instruction, no display refresh
 * and no monitor command can interleave with a burst of draws. Each of
 * those three entry points releases on the way out. A burst is
 * therefore the exact lifetime of a resident target, and the rule needs
 * no dirty-bitmap tracking to be correct.
 *
 * The cost of that conservatism is one seed per burst, and it is
 * measured rather than assumed: `gl-stats` reports the flush count and
 * the pixels moved each way, which is what says whether the batching is
 * working. If a guest turns out to submit one draw per burst the
 * numbers say so directly.
 *
 * gl=verify never lets a GPU pixel reach VRAM at all -- the drawn
 * rectangle is not recorded, so a flush has nothing to do, and the
 * software rasterizer's write to VRAM invalidates the GPU copy behind
 * it. A verify session's VRAM is byte-identical to a gl=off session's,
 * which is the property that makes it a measurement.

 * GL-OWNED DEPTH BUFFER
 * =====================================================================
 *
 * For a backend with a depth buffer of its own (ati_r350_gl_depth(),
 * i.e. Metal), the Z buffer is resident on the host GPU beside the
 * colour target and under EXACTLY the colour target's rules: it is
 * resident only while the colour target is (`gl_zres` implies
 * `gl_res`), so every hook listed above -- scanout, the 2D engine, the
 * CP, MM_DATA, fallbacks, texture reads, reset, and above all the end of
 * every burst -- flushes it and gives it back through the same
 * ati_r350_gl_release(). ati_r350_gl_sync() tests its VRAM span as well
 * as the colour target's.
 *
 * What moves is one Z word per pixel as r300_zb_pixel() reads it --
 * (z24 << 8) | stencil through the swapper at r300_zaddr(), or the
 * linear 16-bit Z -- so the backend never sees tiling. Seeding reads
 * sample 0. Flushing writes a word only where it differs from VRAM, and
 * to both samples of a two-sample buffer, as r300_zb_pixel() does.
 *
 * The one Z WRITER outside the draw path is 3D_CLEAR_ZMASK, which
 * writes VRAM directly: it flushes and drops the resident depth
 * buffer first (R350_GLR_ZCLEAR), leaving the colour target resident.

/*
 * TEXTURE CACHE LIFETIME -- the rule, and why it is no longer the
 * target's.
 *
 * M3 tied a decoded texture's life to the resident render target's:
 * both died at every release, on the argument that those are the
 * moments something outside the 3D engine may have touched VRAM. That
 * is SUFFICIENT but far stronger than necessary, and it is expensive:
 * on Flurry.saver the target is released about once per draw, so the
 * cache read 34 hits against 5990 decodes -- 0.6% -- and
 * r300_gl_decode_tex() took 41% of the vCPU's executing time.
 *
 * What a decoded entry actually depends on is its SOURCE BYTES: it is
 * valid exactly while VRAM in [off, off+len) is unwritten. Every writer
 * is therefore an enforcement point, and each one already exists or is
 * added here:
 *
 *   the 2D engine, host-data     ati_r350_gl_dirty() -> gl_wrote()
 *   pushes, CP write-backs,      kills every overlapping entry
 *   the MM_DATA window
 *
 *   a 3D draw rendering into     r300_gl_bind()'s loop, same test
 *   a cached range
 *
 *   the GUEST CPU through the    THE DIRTY BITMAP. Its stores are
 *   frame-buffer BAR             ordinary host stores with no callback,
 *                                but they set DIRTY_MEMORY_VGA, which
 *                                is the same mechanism the scanout has
 *                                always relied on to notice them.
 *
 *   reset, unrealize             r300_gl_texdrop()
 *
 * READING THE BITMAP WITHOUT DISTURBING IT, AND THE ONE-BIT PROBLEM.
 * The scanout owns that bitmap: it snapshots and CLEARS the whole of
 * VRAM on every refresh, and it decides both what to redraw and where
 * the framebuffer is from what it finds. So this guard never clears a
 * bit and never claims a range -- it only reads.
 *
 * Reading alone is enough only because of how an entry is ADMITTED. A
 * dirty bit does not say WHEN the page was written, so a page that is
 * already dirty when the texture is decoded can never afterwards be
 * distinguished from one written a moment later: the bit is set either
 * way. A baseline of "dirty at decode time" would therefore be a
 * permanent blind spot over exactly those pages. So an entry is
 * admitted to the cache ONLY when every page of its source range reads
 * clean, and from then on ANY set bit is a write that happened since.
 *
 *   admission          every page clean, or the texture is decoded into
 *                      the scratch this time and not cached
 *   between refreshes  r300_gl_tex_current() re-reads the live flags
 *   at a refresh       ati_r350_gl_epoch() is handed the snapshot the
 *                      clear produced -- the only record of what was
 *                      set -- applies the same test to every live entry
 *                      before it is discarded, and carries the
 *                      survivors into the next generation
 *
 * An entry whose generation is not the current one was not carried, so
 * it is killed. Between them the two checks see every write, at page
 * granularity rounded outwards, so the guard errs towards killing.
 *
 * THE PRICE of admission, stated: a texture cannot enter the cache
 * until the bitmap has been cleared since it was last written -- one
 * display refresh after its upload, 16 ms on a live display. It is
 * decoded normally in the meantime.
 *
 * The device's own writes set the same bits and so also kill entries.
 * That is conservative rather than wrong: a flush or a blit into a
 * texture's range really does stale it.
 *
 * THE CONTROL. `gl-texlife=never` switches off EVERY one of the
 * enforcement points above -- the dirty guard, the writer hook's kill
 * and the render-into-a-cached-range kill alike -- so that "the cache
 * is invalidated correctly" is a claim something can disprove. A
 * gl=verify run in that mode must FAIL, and offline the replay harness
 * must diverge, which is what makes this rule a measurement rather
 * than an argument.

 * Does this draw blend against pixels it has already written itself?

 * two primitives of the draw cover the same pixel. The software
 * rasterizer paints them in order and each blends against what the
 * previous one left; a single pass blends both against the ORIGINAL.
 * Flurry.saver's additive ribbons cross themselves inside one draw and
 * differ by up to 229/255 because of it, measured by gl=verify.
 *
 * M2 made those draws fall back to the software rasterizer, which cost
 * the offload most of its speed: the same binary without the fallback
 * measured 14.96 fps against 10.23 -- and rendered Flurry wrong. M3
 * wins that back by ORDERING them instead. The triangles are
 * partitioned into passes such that no two in a pass overlap and any
 * overlapping pair lands in the device's own order, and the backend
 * refreshes the blend's source between passes with a GPU-side copy.
 * The result is the software path's ordering, computed on the GPU.
 *
 * The test is exact rather than a bounding box, because a bounding box
 * would put every quad of Chess's board in its own pass -- 1048 blended
 * quad-strip draws the offline harness measures as correct through GL
 * to a maximum channel delta of 1. Two triangles are separated when
 * some edge normal projects them to intervals that do not overlap in a
 * positive length, so a shared edge (the two halves of a quad, or two
 * quads of a strip) reads as disjoint, which is what keeps an ordinary

 * ...and the draw that needs none of it, because GL's own blender can
 * keep the device's order for free.
 *
 * THE PREDICATE, stated exactly: for colour and for alpha alike, the
 * combine function is ADD, the DESTINATION factor is ONE, and the
 * SOURCE factor does not read the destination. The blend is then
 *
 *      dst' = clamp(dst + f(src))
 *
 * and two things follow that nothing else here enjoys. The destination
 * term is the destination unchanged, so a per-primitive quantisation
 * needs no read: the device's byte is already an integer and the
 * fragment shader can hand GL floor(255*f(src)) to add to it, which is
 * the device's truncating pack, once per primitive, in primitive order.
 * And no factor looks at the destination, so no snapshot of it is
 * needed -- the seed and the between-pass copy both disappear.
 *
 * That is what makes the ordered partition unnecessary for this family
 * rather than merely cheaper. Flurry.saver's ribbons are the family:
 * every one of the 1899 draws M3 measured as `self-overlapping blend
 * prim 13` fallbacks blends additively, each a quad list of up to 456
 * self-crossing triangles that the partition either spread over many
 * passes or refused outright. The SAT machinery stays for everything
 * whose destination term is not the destination -- an ordinary
 * SRC_ALPHA/ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA composite cannot use this, because
 * there the destination is scaled before it is added and the scaled
 * value is not on the byte grid.
 *
 * IT IS NOT EXACT, AND THAT IS WHY IT IS BEHIND gl=fast RATHER THAN ON
 * BY DEFAULT. Measured on a Flurry corpus of 94 replayable draws
 * (doc/radeon9800/flurry-glcap-2026-08-26.bin.gz) against the software
 * rasterizer, and live with gl=verify:
 *
 *   ordered passes, limit raised so nothing is refused
 *       INTERIOR 99.9314% at delta 0, EDGE 0.0001%, ribbon max delta 4
 *   this path
 *       INTERIOR 99.3857% at delta 0, EDGE 1.1854%, ribbon max delta 45
 *   live gl=verify over a Flurry session
 *       VALUE 99.9628% -> 98.8267% at delta 0, COVER 0.1022%
 *
 * What it buys is 22.93 fps against 13.19, with the self-overlap
 * fallback count going 665 -> 0 (1899 -> 0 against the milestone's own
 * pass limit) and the vCPU at 71.5% of a core. The residue is a
 * per-primitive rounding decomposition that accumulates over a pixel's
 * overlap depth: the device computes trunc((t + D/255)*255) and this
 * path computes D + trunc(255*t), and the two disagree wherever 255*t
 * lands within a few ULPs of an integer -- which for a ribbon crossing
 * itself thirty times is thirty chances to differ by one. On screen the
 * two are indistinguishable; in numbers they are not, so the choice is
 * the user's and `on` stays exact.
 *
 * Codes are r300_blend_f()'s own; both encodings of each factor are
 * listed because the register uses both.

 * gl=verify's scoring, over one rectangle.

 * EDGE, because the two classes have very different criteria: an
 * interior pixel is arithmetic and must agree to 1/255, an edge pixel
 * is a coverage tie that GL and a software fill rule are allowed to
 * resolve differently. Doing that here would mean rasterizing a third
 * time.
 *
 * It is not necessary. The record already holds the destination BEFORE
 * the draw, so "did this path write this pixel" is readable from the
 * data: a pixel where exactly one of the two paths changed the
 * destination is a COVERAGE disagreement -- the edge class by
 * definition -- and a pixel both of them changed (or neither) is a
 * VALUE disagreement, the interior class. No rasterization, and the
 * classification is the one the criteria are actually about.
 *
 * Conservative in the safe direction: a path that writes a pixel the
 * value it already held reads as "did not write", which can only move a
 * pixel out of the coverage class and into the stricter one.
 *
 * One class of tie this cannot see, and it is counted separately rather
 * than left to be argued about. Inside a MESH -- a strip, a fan, or a
 * quad list of more than one quad -- two adjacent triangles share an
 * edge, and a pixel exactly on it is awarded to one of them by the fill
 * rule. Both paths write such a pixel, so the coverage test above puts
 * it in the value class, but the two triangles can carry completely
 * different texture coordinates (Chess's board samples a different part
 * of its wood texture per square), so the disagreement is full-range.
 * `gl_v_mesh` is how many of the value-class disagreements come from a
 * draw with more than two triangles; the offline harness, which
 * replays the acceptance test and can see the tie, classifies exactly
 * those as EDGE.
