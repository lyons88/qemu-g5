/*
 * QEMU ATI Radeon 9800 Pro (R350) emulation
 *
 * Models the ATI Radeon 9800 Pro Mac Edition (PCI vendor 0x1002, device
 * 0x4E48) as an AGP add-in graphics card for the mac99 (PowerMac3,4)
 * machine. Forked from our ati_rage128 device: the Radeon keeps the Rage
 * 128 register lineage for the display controller (CRTC/DAC/palette/
 * cursor/I2C/GPIO), the 2D GUI engine (0x14xx), the scratch registers
 * and the PM4 command-stream format, so all of that is inherited; what
 * changes is the identity, the aperture layout (128MB frame buffer
 * BAR, 64KB register BAR), the memory-controller address windows
 * (MC_FB_LOCATION / MC_AGP_LOCATION -- engine and CP addresses are
 * card addresses, not frame-buffer offsets), the CP ring (CP_RB_*,
 * read-pointer and scratch write-back), RBBM_STATUS, the SURFACE_CNTL
 * byte swappers that replace CONFIG_CNTL's aperture endian modes, and
 * the R300 3D engine (not modeled: packets are parsed and skipped).
 *
 * Ground truth: the retail 9800 Pro Mac SE / OEM 9800 XT FCode ROMs
 * (detokenized 2026-08-24), Mac OS X 10.4.11's ATIRadeon9700.kext, the
 * Linux radeon DRM and X.org radeon drivers, and AMD's public R3xx
 * register references.
