 * missed ~23% of VBLs (its ISR/other interrupt work often exceeded
 * 2 ms, and a level source that goes low before it is taken is simply

 * Mac OS X 10.2 and Mac OS 9.2) found CRTC1's "Extended" mode-set
 * registers are never programmed by either guest OS at all -- not
 * through direct MMIO, not through MM_INDEX/MM_DATA, not through PM4
 * -- so ati_r350_maybe_capture_mode() only ever captures whatever
 * mode Open Firmware's own boot console happened to establish once at
 * power-on. That's sufficient as long as the guest keeps using that
 * exact mode (confirmed live: OS X mirroring at 256 colors/8bpp
 * renders cleanly, matching that original boot mode) -- but switching
 * to a higher color depth makes the guest draw its real desktop
 * somewhere else in VRAM instead, through a mechanism that still
 * isn't understood, and the last-known-good CRTC1 mode has no way to
 * find it.
 *
 * What IS observable is that switching to a real live framebuffer
 * writes a large, contiguous block of VRAM at least once -- so scan
 * VRAM periodically (via QEMU's own per-MemoryRegion dirty-bitmap
 * tracking, the same DIRTY_MEMORY_VGA mechanism every other display
 * device uses to skip redrawing unchanged scanlines -- reused here
 * for discovery instead) for the largest contiguous span that was
 * written at all recently, and treat it as the real framebuffer once
 * it's been confirmed against a plausible resolution. A single write
 * is trusted immediately (a mostly-static desktop -- no cursor blink,
 * no clock tick landing in the scanned region -- may only ever paint
 * a freshly-switched mode once and then sit idle, so waiting for
 * *repeated* activity would miss it entirely); the size-vs-known-
 * resolution match already filters out noise from small, unrelated
 * writes, so a low per-block bar is safe here. The decay counter
 * still ages a region out over several idle scans once superseded,
 * so switching back to an earlier mode is eventually noticed too.

 * registers answer at once with its progress. Everything else --
 * display, cursor, interrupts, clocks -- belongs to the BQL, which a
 * command stream write to it takes.
 *
 * The GL target is the engine's while it runs: a hook on another thread
 * finds it busy and leaves the target alone (ati_r350_gl_mine()). The

/*
 * Hardware cursor. The image always sits at CUR_OFFSET in the frame
 * buffer and is always 64x64, but CRTC_CUR_MODE (CRTC_GEN_CNTL[22:20])
 * picks one of three pixel formats:
 *
 *   0  a two-colour bitmap, 16 bytes per row: eight bytes of AND mask
 *      followed by eight of XOR mask, most significant bit leftmost.
 *      (AND,XOR) selects CUR_CLR0, CUR_CLR1, "leave the destination
 *      alone" or "invert it". CUR_CLR0/1 are plain 0x00RRGGBB here, NOT
 *      the mach64's colour-in-bits-31:8 layout.
 *   1  32 bits per pixel, 256 bytes per row: 0x00RRGGBB is an opaque
 *      colour, 0x80000000 transparent and 0x80FFFFFF inverting. This is
 *      what the ndrv emits when it converted a 2-bit source cursor, so
 *      it carries the classic codes but never uses CUR_CLR0/1.
 *   3  32 bits per pixel, 256 bytes per row, straight ARGB with
 *      per-pixel alpha; 0x00000000 is the transparent code.
 *
 * Modes 1 and 3 are what the retail 9800 ROM's ndrv actually programs,
 * established by static RE of its cscSetHardwareCursor path (a deframed
 * copy of the PEF and the tooling live in doc/radeon9800/ndrv-re/): the
 * control handler tries VSLPrepareCursorForHardwareCursor with a 64x64
 * ARGB descriptor first and a 64x64 2-bit one second, converts either
 * result to 64x64 32-bit pixels, BlockCopy()s 0x4000 bytes into VRAM at
 * (slot << 14), and writes CUR_MODE 3 or 1 to match. Mac OS X takes the
 * ARGB descriptor (slot 0, CUR_OFFSET 0), Mac OS 9 the 2-bit one
 * (slot 1, CUR_OFFSET 0x4000) -- both offsets seen live.
 *
 * The ndrv stores those pixels little-endian: it reads the aperture's
 * byte-swap mode out of SURFACE_CNTL[21:20] and pre-swaps its buffer so
 * that VRAM ends up holding LE dwords whichever way the swapper is set.
 * ati_r350_vram_ld32() is therefore exactly the right reader.
 *
 * Mode 0's row layout is inherited from this device's ati_rage128
 * ancestor, where it was confirmed against a live image; it has NOT been
 * re-confirmed on the R350, which has only ever been seen in modes 1
 * and 3. QEMUCursor data is RGBA byte order, i.e. a dword of
 * (a << 24) | (b << 16) | (g << 8) | r (ui/cursor.c).
 *
 * "Invert the destination" has no QEMUCursor equivalent, so it becomes
 * 50%-alpha black -- the same approximation the mach64 uses, and the
 * classic Mac cursors only use that code to soften edges.
